I created some visualizations to show the spread of COVID-19 using [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/)

## Number of COVID-19 cases per state in India over time

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-bar-chart-race" data-src="visualisation/2301431" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/2301431/embed"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Data was pulled from the [COVID19-India API](https://api.covid19india.org/).<br>
You can find a cleaned version of the data I used [here](/assets/documents/covid-19-visualizations/India-time-series-COVID-19-cases-by-state.csv).


## Number of COVID-19 cases per ward in Pune over time

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-bar-chart-race" data-src="visualisation/2304825" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/2304825/embed"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Data was scrapped from maps posted by [@smartpune](https://twitter.com/SmartPune?s=20).<br>
