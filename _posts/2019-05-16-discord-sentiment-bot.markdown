A simple bot that analysis the sentiment of a message using the TextBlob library.

The bot requires no special permissions to run and can be called by prefixing a sentence with the following
> s.text

It respondes with the sentiment of the suffixed statement and whether it is subjective or not.

I have hosted it on a Heroku dyno. If you prefer, you can also host it yourself using the repo.
