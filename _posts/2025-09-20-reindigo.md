# ReIndigo

**Continuing the legacy of Indigo**

[View source code on GitHub](https://github.com/DoubleGremlin181/indigo)

ReIndigo is a continuation of the [Indigo](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo) Jekyll theme, which I’ve been using as my website theme for over 6 years. While Indigo still works great, over time I've added some features that improved usability and fit my needs better — and that’s how ReIndigo was born.

## Features

### Interactive Plots

Embed interactive visualizations in your posts with **Bokeh**

{% include plots/reindigo/example.html %}

### LaTeX Support

Write math seamlessly using **MathJax**

$$Y_i = f(X_i, \beta) + \varepsilon_i$$

### Improved Tags Page

Tags are now **counted** and **sorted** by most common for easier navigation

### Sitemap

A `sitemap.xml` is generated automatically via the **jekyll-sitemap** gem for better SEO

## Credits

ReIndigo builds on the excellent work of [Sergio Kopplin](https://github.com/sergiokopplin) and all the [contributors](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo/graphs/contributors) to the Indigo theme. Without their design and foundation, this project wouldn’t exist.
