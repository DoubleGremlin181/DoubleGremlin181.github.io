# Fast Travel

**Supercharge your search bar**

Fast Travel is a Bunnylol-inspired, configurable, command-based search engine replacement that you can easily host on GitHub Pages. It streamlines your searches and navigates the web quickly with a lightweight, static engine designed for speed and simplicity.

For example:

- Typing `g kittens` will search for "kittens" on Google.
- Typing `ddg privacy` will search for "privacy" on DuckDuckGo.
- Typing `r/technology` will take you directly to the r/technology subreddit.
- Typing `hn` will take you directly to Hacker News.
- Typing `apps balatro` will search for "balatro" on Steam on desktop, the Google Play Store on Android, and the App Store on iOS.
- Typing `$AAPL` will open the Yahoo Finance stock quote page for AAPL.

## Features

- **Configurable Commands:** Easily modify, add, or remove search commands.
- **Lightweight & Fast:** Optimized for speed with a minimalistic design and static hosting.
- **Device-Aware Routing:** Automatically directs your queries based on your device (Windows, Android, iOS, etc.).
- **Typo Detection:** Automatically detects and suggests corrections for misspelled commands.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Fork the Repository:**  
   Click the "Fork" button on the repository page to create your own copy.

2. **Deploy on GitHub Pages:**  
   - Update the page URL in your repository settings (navigate to `Settings > Pages > Custom domain`) or configure the `CNAME` file.
   - It is recommended to use a subdomain (e.g., `fast-travel.yourdomain.com`) or a root domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`) rather than deploying on a subdirectory (e.g., `yourdomain.com/fast-travel`), as not all platforms correctly recognize subdirectory URLs for search engines.

3. **Optional – Enable GitHub Actions:**  
   If you experience workflow failures, consider enabling GitHub Actions with write access to ensure necessary updates are applied.

4. **Optional – Update Your Config:**  
   Open the `config.json` file to modify, add, or remove commands and routes.

5. **Replace Your Search Engine:**  
   Follow these steps to replace your default search engine in popular browsers:

    <details>
    <summary><strong>Chrome on Windows/MacOS</strong></summary>

    1. Open **Settings > Search Engine > Manage search engines** or paste `chrome://settings/searchEngines` into your address bar.
    2. In the "Site search" (or "Other search engines") section, click **Add**.
    3. Fill in the details:
    - **Search engine:** Fast Travel
    - **Shortcut:** (e.g., `ft`)
    - **URL:** `https://fast-travel.yourdomain.com?q=%s`
    4. Click **Add**.
    5. Next to your new entry, click the menu icon and select **Make default**.
    </details>

    <details>
    <summary><strong>Chrome on Android/iOS</strong></summary>

    1. Visit your Fast Travel page (e.g., `https://fast-travel.yourdomain.com`).
    2. Perform a search using Fast Travel. (Don't skip this step.)
    3. Tap the three dots in the top-right corner.
    4. Choose **Settings**, then **Search engine**.
    5. Select **Fast Travel** from the "Recently visited" section.
    </details>

    <details>
    <summary><strong>Firefox on Windows/MacOS</strong></summary>

    1. Visit your Fast Travel page (e.g., `https://fast-travel.yourdomain.com`).
    2. Right-click on the address bar and choose **Add Fast Travel**.
    3. Open the hamburger menu in the top-right corner, then go to **Settings > Search**.
    4. In the "Default Search Engine" section, select **Fast Travel** from the drop-down menu.
    </details>

    <details>
    <summary><strong>Firefox on Android/iOS</strong></summary>

    1. Tap the three dots in the top-right corner.
    2. Choose **Settings**, then **Search**.
    3. Select **Default Search Engine**, then **+ Add Search Engine**
    4. Fill in the details:
    - **Name:** Fast Travel
    - **Search string URL:** `https://fast-travel.yourdomain.com?q=%s`
    5. Select Fast Travel
    </details>

    **Note:**  
     Using a custom domain (like `fast-travel.yourdomain.com` or `yourdomain.com`) is preferred over a subdirectory deployment for optimal compatibility.

## How the Commands Work

Fast Travel uses a command-based syntax defined in the `config.json` file. Commands are processed sequentially—if a query matches multiple patterns, the first match is used. Here’s how to use and customize them:

### Basic Command Usage

- **Open the Page:**  
  - **Syntax:** `<command>`  
  - **Example:** Typing `g` opens the default Google homepage.

- **Search a Query:**  
  - **Syntax:** `<command> <query>`  
  - **Example:** Typing `g kittens` searches for "kittens" on Google using the command's fallback URL.

- **Prefix Commands**  
  - **Syntax:** `<prefix><term>[ <additional query>]`  
  - **Examples:**  
    - Typing `r/technology` immediately opens the Reddit page for the r/technology subreddit.
    - Typing `$AAPL` opens the Yahoo Finance quote page for AAPL.

- **Subcommands / Custom Patterns**
  - **Syntax:** `<command> <subcommand>/<query>` or using a custom regex defined in the config.  
  - **Examples:**  
    - Typing `yt subs` opens your YouTube subscriptions.
    - Typing `gh u/DoubleGremlin181` searches for DoubleGremlin181's profile on GitHub.

### OS-Specific Options

Fast Travel adjusts its behavior based on your device’s operating system. The `config.json` file includes routes optimized for various platforms:

- **Desktop:** Windows, MacOS, Linux
- **Mobile:** Android, iOS
- **Fallback:** Use `*` to apply to all devices

For instance, the `apps` command provides different routing options depending on whether you’re on Android (using the Play Store), iOS (using the App Store), or Desktop (using the Steam Store).

### Customizing Commands

- **Editing the Config:**  
  Open the `config.json` file to modify, add, or remove commands and their routes. You can customize:
  - **Default URLs:** The page that opens when no query is provided.
  - **Fallback URLs:** Used for searches by appending the query to a specified URL.
  - **Custom Patterns:** Regex or pattern-based routing (e.g., `gh u/DoubleGremlin181`) for advanced operations. These patterns typically follow the `subcommand/<parameter>` structure.
  - **Type:** Commands can either be `default` (space delimited) or `prefix` (starts with) type.

- **Order of Processing:**  
  The file is parsed sequentially. If a query matches multiple patterns, the first match is used. Arrange your custom patterns accordingly to ensure the desired behavior.

Tip: Adding `debug=true` to the URL parameters prints debug statements to the console and adds a 3s delay.
