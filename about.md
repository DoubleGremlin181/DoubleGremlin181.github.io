<h2>About Me</h2>

Hey there! 👋 My name is <strong>Kavish Hukmani</strong>, and I'm a passionate 🥇, creative 🎨, and perceptive 🔭 engineer 🔧 with a hands-on approach to problem-solving and an unending thirst for knowledge 📚. Anything and everything that can be classified as technology 💻 fascinates me.

Currently, I'm based in the beautiful city of San Francisco 🌉 where I work as a Data Scientist 🧑‍🔬 at Unison, tackling fascinating problems in Finance 💰, Housing 🏠, and Marketing 📣. Before that, I was part of the Impact Analytics team, creating products that helped top Retail 💃 and CPG 🍫 companies make data-driven decisions like a breeze. Oh, and I proudly hold an MS in Business Analytics 📊 from UC Davis 🎓.

When I'm not immersed in the world of technology, you can find me following a range of sports, from Soccer ⚽ and Formula1 🏎️ to various eSports 🖱️. Apart from that, I love solving puzzles 🧩 and listening to music 🎶.

I'm always open to new ideas and opportunities. You can learn more about me on my [GitHub](https://github.com/DoubleGremlin181/) 🌐 or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kavish-hukmani/) 👥. Feel free to reach out to me directly at [khukmani@gmail.com](mailto:khukmani@gmail.com) 📧. Let's connect and explore exciting possibilities together! 🚀
