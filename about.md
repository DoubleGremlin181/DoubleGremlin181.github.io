<h2>About Me</h2>

Hey there! 👋 My name is <strong>Kavish Hukmani</strong>, and I'm a passionate 🥇, creative 🎨, and perceptive 🔭 engineer 🔧 with a hands-on approach to problem-solving and an unending thirst for knowledge 📚. Anything and everything that can be classified as technology 💻 fascinates me.

Currently, I'm based in the beautiful city of San Francisco 🌉 where I work as an Analytics Professional 📊 at Meta, using GenAI to parse feedback on facilities 🏢 and culinary services 🍽️ for over 100k employees and contractors worldwide. Previously, I was a Data Scientist 🧑‍🔬 at Unison, focusing on challenges in Finance 💰, Housing 🏠, and Marketing 📣. Before that, I contributed to the Impact Analytics team, developing products that facilitated data-driven decision-making for leading Retail 💃 and CPG 🍫 companies. Oh, and I proudly hold an MS in Business Analytics 📈 from UC Davis 🎓.

When I'm not immersed in the world of technology, you can find me following a range of sports, from Soccer ⚽ and Formula1 🏎️ to various eSports 🖱️. Apart from that, I love solving puzzles 🧩 and listening to music 🎶.

I'm always open to new ideas and opportunities. You can learn more about me on my [GitHub](https://github.com/DoubleGremlin181/) 🌐 or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kavish-hukmani/) 👥.
