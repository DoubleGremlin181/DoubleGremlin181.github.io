<h2>About Me</h2>

I'm a passionate, creative and perceptive engineer with a hands-on approach to problem-solving and an unending thirst for knowledge. Anything and everything that can be classified as technology fascinates me. My interests and work range from Data Science to creating Chatbots to building APIs for Computer Vision applications to making AR filters for Instagram and much more.

I also follow a number of sports ranging from Football, Formula1 to various eSports. Other than that, I love solving puzzles and listening to music.

I am always open to new ideas and opportunities.
