<h2>About Me</h2>

My name is <strong>Kavish Hukmani</strong>, and I am a passionate, creative, and perceptive engineer with a hands-on approach to problem-solving and an unending thirst for knowledge. Anything and everything that can be classified as technology fascinates me.

I currently live in San Francisco and am pursuing my MSBA at UC Davis. I previously worked as a Data Scientist at Impact Analytics, creating products that enabled leading retail and CPG firms to make data-driven decisions easily.

I follow a number of sports ranging from Soccer, Formula1 to various eSports. Other than that, I love solving puzzles and listening to music.

I am always open to new ideas and opportunities. You can learn more about me on [GitHub](https://github.com/DoubleGremlin181/) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kavish-hukmani/) or reach out to me directly at [khukmani@gmail.com](mailto:khukmani@gmail.com)
